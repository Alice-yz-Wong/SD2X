- perspective on quality:
    transcendental,user,manufacturer, product, value-based
- External quality:executable program
    functionality, reliability,usability,efficiency,portability,security
  Internal quality: readable
    maintainability: analizability, changeablitiy, stability, testability

Internal quality 
    - analyzability:  read understand the code
    - changeability: 
    - stablity: tolerant of changes to other part of code
    - testability:

Three tier architecture:
    presentation: get input from user, display output
    logic: Perform claculation, make decisions
    data: store and retrieve data

Software design concept:
    modularity, each component-single functionality
    functional independence
    abstraction

Coupling
    - loose Coupling: one depends on another
    - tight Coupling: both depend on each other
